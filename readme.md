# AllJoyn-Lifx-Lamp-Component
This project contains:
- an AllJoyn Component that discovers a Lifx Lamp and an
example App of controlling (on/off, color) a single Lifx Lamp.

- an AllJoyn Light App as an example of how to use the AllJoyn Component.

The AllJoynComponent Project has a relationship with the [dotMorten.AllJoyn.AllJoynClientLib] (https://github.com/dotMorten/AllJoynClientLib) Project.

The AllJoyn Light App Project uses a Flipview control , with pre-defined colored lamps
- red
- green
- blue
- yellow
- white
- no color (transparent)

![A Figure of the App is shown here:] (https://github.com/niko-kokkinos/AllJoyn-Lifx-Lamp-Component/blob/master/nikokokkinos.AllJoynLightApp/AppImages/all.png)

By selecting the desired colored Lamp , the user can tap on it and the color
of the Lamp will change in the room.

# HACKATHON BONN - RFID Lamp
